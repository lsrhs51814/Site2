  <h1><p>After the drill finishes, you break off from your friend and go back to class. No one from your class has shown up yet. Weird. You sit in the dark classroom for another half an hour. What is going on?! Finally, your teacher comes in at the end of the block and informs you that she canceled the remainder of the class and that you would've known had you not wandered off. Whatever, at least you got to hang out with your friend!</p></h1>
