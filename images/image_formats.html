  <center><h2>PNG Images</h2><center>
  <p>The acronym "PNG" stands for Portable Network Graphics file. Generally, PNG is considered the 'replacement' for GIF image files, though unlike GIF, PNG doesn't support animations. PNG files are used to store graphics on websites, and are good to use for creating and supporting transparent images (the pixels can be transparent, so for example, a white background of a logo doesn't show up). PNG is also useful for images that use text or large areas of solid color. PNG uses "lossless compression", which allows it to be edited over and over again.</p>

  <center><h2>JPEG Images</h2><center>
  <p>JPEG is a common form of lossy compression for images. It is used very commonly in a number of file formats, and can be used by digital cameras and other photographic devices. These types of devices also will save images as JPEG files. They're convenient and easy to access.</p>

  <center><h2>GIF Images</h2><center>
  <p>GIF images are images in a format that supports both static and animated images. It has several image frames embedded in one image file, so a web browser or software will play those frames in a certain order automatically, making the image look like it's moving. GIFs don't require pressing play and they don't feature any audio- they're just endless loops of animation.</p>
