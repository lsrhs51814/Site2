  <h1>Citizenship</h1>

  <h2>What is a Citizen?</h2>
  <p>Merriam-Webster defines citizenship as "membership in a community... the quality of an individual's response to membership in a community" [1].</p>

  <h2>What Components Make a Good Citizen?</h2>

  <h3>Honesty</h3>
  <p>Honesty is defined as "fairness and straightforwardness of conduct" and "adherence to the facts" [2].</p>
  <p>Honesty is a significant part of citizenship. A citizen must be honest and honorable to be able to uphold good citizenship and to be dedicated to being a positive member of society.</p>

  <h3>Compassion</h3>
  <p>The dictionary definition of compassion is "a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for another who is stricken by misfortune, accompanied by a strong desire to alleviate the suffering" [3]</p>
  <p>A good citizen should be compassionate for other citizens and those around them. Citizenship relates to supporting others in one's community, and compassion for those others is an important quality for a good citizen to possess.</p>

  <h3>Respect</h3>
  <p>The dictionary explains respect as "esteem for or a sense of the worth or excellence of a person, a personal quality or ability, or something considered as a manifestation of a personal quality or ability" [4].</p>
  <p>Respect is an important quality for a good citizen to uphold. One should respect their country or organization, even if they don't agree with that organization at all times. Respect includes hearing an opposing side or view and sharing one's own opinion in an intelligent, communicative manner.</p>

  <h3>Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Responsibility means "the state or fact of being responsible, answerable, or accountable for something within one's power, control, or management" [5].</p>
  <p>Although citizens are permitted rights, they carry responsibility. Citizens have to be polite and productive members of society, which is a responsibility that many citizens take on already.</p>

  <h3>Courage</h3>
  <p>Courage is defined as "the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, pain, etc., without fear; bravery" [6].</p>
  <p>Courage is not necessarily a prominent quality of citizenship (although it isn't negative). Very valuable citizens aren't necessarily typically courageous, but they can still contribute greatly to communities in their own ways.</p>
